## **Lesson Plan**

### **Setup (5 min)**
- Navigate to the project directory and create the required `index.html` and `style.css` files.
- Use Emmet to add boilerplate HTML, linking the CSS file within the `<head>`.
- Open the file in a browser for live preview.

**Activity:**
- Guide students to set up their development environment and create the project structure.

---

### **Concepts (2 min)**
- Overview of CSS: What it is and its purpose.
    - CSS controls a web page's layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects.
- Analogy: CSS is like decorating a house, where HTML provides the structure.
- Explain the separation of content (HTML) and presentation (CSS).
    - CSS enables us to separate a document's structure & content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS).
  
**Activity:**
- Demonstrate adding a simple CSS rule to change the text color of an `<h1>` tag to blue.

### **CSS Fundamentals (10 min)**
- ✨ **Diagram - [discuss syntax](https://raw.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/intro-to-css/main/fundamentals/assets/css-syntax.png?token=AAALP5NLYRS2YUVL4DXX5NTHRTD44):** Break down a CSS rule (selector, property, value).
    - **1)** Selectors: Used to target the element(s) to be styled and range from simple to incredibly complex.
    - **2)** Properties are written in lower-kebab-case
    - **3)** Value: The valid values that can be applied to a property are specific to that property.
    - **4)** Declaration: The combination of a property and value, separated by a colon and ending with a semi-colon, makes a declaration.
    - **5)** Rule: A selector and all of its associated declarations.
- ✨ **Selectors:** CSS element selectors target every instance of a specific HTML element
- ✨ **Comments:** Show how to add single-line and multi-line comments.
- ```css
  p {
  color: purple; /*All p elements will now have purple text!*/
    }
  ```

**🧑‍💻 Activity:**

### **Box Model (15 min)**
- ✨ **Diagram - [Everything is a box](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/intro-to-css/blob/main/box-model/assets/box-model.png):** Visualize the box model and its impact on layout.
- ✨ Explain the four parts of the box model: content, padding, border, margin.
- ✨ [Padding](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/intro-to-css/blob/main/box-model/assets/button.png) is the space between the content of an element and its border.
    - ```css
      p {
          /* all four sides */
          padding: 2px;
        }

      p {
          padding-bottom: 1px;
          padding-left: 2px;
          padding-right: 3px;
          padding-top: 4px;
        }
      ```

- ✨ Border - the area (typically a line) surrounding the padding. Borders are useful for separating elements from each other
    - ```css
      p {
          border: 3px solid red;
        }
      /* we could break this into three lines */
      p {
          border-width: 3px;
          border-style: solid;
          border-color: red;
        }
      ```
