## **Lesson Plan**

### **Setup (5 min)**
- Navigate to the project directory and create the required `index.html` and `style.css` files.
- Use Emmet to add boilerplate HTML, linking the CSS file within the `<head>`.
- Open the file in a browser for live preview.

**Activity:**
- Guide students to set up their development environment and create the project structure.

---

### **Concepts (2 min)**
- Overview of CSS: What it is and its purpose.
    - CSS controls a web page's layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects.
- Analogy: CSS is like decorating a house, where HTML provides the structure.
- Explain the separation of content (HTML) and presentation (CSS).
    - CSS enables us to separate a document's structure & content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS).
  
**Activity:**
- Demonstrate adding a simple CSS rule to change the text color of an `<h1>` tag to blue.

### **CSS Fundamentals (10 min)**
- ✨ **Diagram - [discuss syntax](https://raw.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/intro-to-css/main/fundamentals/assets/css-syntax.png?token=AAALP5NLYRS2YUVL4DXX5NTHRTD44):** Break down a CSS rule (selector, property, value).
    - **1)** Selectors: Used to target the element(s) to be styled and range from simple to incredibly complex.
    - **2)** Properties are written in lower-kebab-case
    - **3)** Value: The valid values that can be applied to a property are specific to that property.
    - **4)** Declaration: The combination of a property and value, separated by a colon and ending with a semi-colon, makes a declaration.
    - **5)** Rule: A selector and all of its associated declarations.
- ✨ **Selectors:** CSS element selectors target every instance of a specific HTML element
- ✨ **Comments:** Show how to add single-line and multi-line comments.
- ```css
  p {
  color: purple; /*All p elements will now have purple text!*/
    }
  ```

**🧑‍💻 Activity:**
- Add CSS to change text color, font size, and text alignment for an `<h1>` element.

**🙋‍♀️ Student Picker Questions:**
<details>
<summary>What are the components of a CSS rule?</summary>
Selector, property, and value.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How do you add a comment in CSS?</summary>
Use `/* comment */`.
</details>

### **Box Model (15 min)**
- ✨ **Diagram - [Everything is a box](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/intro-to-css/blob/main/box-model/assets/box-model.png):** Visualize the box model and its impact on layout.
- ✨ Explain the four parts of the box model: content, padding, border, margin.
- ✨ [Padding](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/intro-to-css/blob/main/box-model/assets/button.png) is the space between the content of an element and its border.
    - ```css
      p {
          /* all four sides */
          padding: 2px;
        }

      p {
          padding-bottom: 1px;
          padding-left: 2px;
          padding-right: 3px;
          padding-top: 4px;
        }
      ```

- ✨ Border - the area (typically a line) surrounding the padding. Borders are useful for separating elements from each other
    - ```css
      p {
          border: 3px solid red;
        }
      /* we could break this into three lines */
      p {
          border-width: 3px;
          border-style: solid;
          border-color: red;
        }
      ```
- ✨ Margin is the space between the border and other elements.
    - ```css
         p {
          /* all four sides */
          margin: 2px;
        }
      ```
    - `margin-top`, `margin-right`, and so on are also available.
**🧑‍💻 Activity:**
- Style a `<div>` to explore padding, border, and margin effects.

**🙋‍♀️ Student Picker Questions:**
<details>
<summary>What is padding?</summary>
The space between content and the border of an element.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is margin?</summary>
The space between the border of an element and adjacent elements.
</details>

### **Common Properties (10 min)**
CSS properties are used to control the appearance and behavior of HTML elements. There are many different CSS properties, but some of the most common ones are font properties, color, and background.

- ✨ Font properties: `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `font-style`, `text-align`.
    - ```css
      h2 {
          font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
          font-size: 28px;
          font-weight: bold;
          font-style: italic;
          text-align: center;
        }
      ```

- ✨ Color properties: Hex (`#FF0000`), RGB `rgb(255, 0, 0)`, and named colors (`red`) - all 3 of those will give us the same color!
    - There are only [140 predefined color keywords](http://web.simmons.edu/~grovesd/comm244/notes/week3/css3-color-names) in CSS, but over 16 million possible hex/RGB color combinations exist.


**🎓 You Do (1):**
Take a few minutes and visit one of the following resources and learn more about a couple of properties of your choosing:

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/) - one of the best sites for all things CSS
- [codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/#section_css-property)

After you've learned about that property, apply it in your code.

**🎓 You Do (2):**

Now that you've learned about some common properties, let's get some more practice.

- Set the margin on `<body>` element to 0 on all four sides. This is a common reset we do on all our pages because most browsers give a margin to the body element, which we usually do not want.
- Also, give the background of the `<body>` element a color of `lightgray`.
- Set the margin on the `<ul>` elements to 0 on all four sides.
- Set the text color of all `<div>` elements to `blue`.

**🙋‍♀️ Student Picker Questions:**
<details>
<summary>What are the three ways to specify a color in CSS?</summary>
Hex, RGB, and color names.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What does `font-family` do?</summary>
Specifies the font for the text.
</details>

### **Selectors (10 min)**
- ✨ Explain element, ID, and class selectors.
- ✨ Demonstrate combinator selectors (e.g., descendant selector).

**🧑‍💻 Activity:**
- Use class and ID selectors to style specific elements.
- Experiment with descendant selectors.

**🙋‍♀️ Student Picker Questions:**
<details>
<summary>How do you target an element with a specific ID?</summary>
Use `#id` in CSS.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the difference between class and ID selectors?</summary>
Class selectors can be reused; ID selectors must be unique.
</details>

---

### **Multiple Stylesheets (5 min)**
- ✨ Discuss the benefits of organizing CSS into multiple files.
- ✨ Explain the order of precedence when loading stylesheets.

**🧑‍💻 Activity:**
- Add a second stylesheet to handle specific styles and observe precedence.

**🙋‍♀️ Student Picker Questions:**
<details>
<summary>Why might you use multiple stylesheets?</summary>
For organization and easier maintenance.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Which stylesheet has higher precedence?</summary>
The one listed later in the HTML `<head>`.
</details>

---

### **CSS Variables (10 min)**
- ✨ Define and use CSS variables.
- ✨ Explain inheritance and reusability with variables.

**🧑‍💻 Activity:**
- Define a `--primary-color` variable and use it across multiple rules.
- Update the variable to observe changes.

**🙋‍♀️ Student Picker Questions:**
<details>
<summary>How do you define a CSS variable?</summary>
Use `--variable-name: value;`.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How do you use a CSS variable?</summary>

### **Level-Up Content**
#### **Shorthand Properties (5 min)**

#### **History of CSS (5 min)**
- ✨ Brief overview of CSS evolution and its impact on web development.
